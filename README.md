# MIPS Datapath Simulator
This project is meant to resemble the MIPS assembly datapath.


<p align="justify">
  This project has a simple GUI so it can show us the movement of content through the registers and the wires. 
  The simulator has various instructions that can be used, these include R types, I types, and J types. 
  Furthermore, I used arrays to mimic the memory addresses and their respective contents. Once the user enters an 
  existing instruction of their choice in the first GUI popup, they will be shown which component has what value in 
  it, which register stores what value, the Control Signals for it, and so on. The essential feature of the
  simulator is that everything stays updated as you move forward.

  The instructions implemented are:  
  - **R-Types**: add, and, or, nor, slt
  - **I-Types**: addi, and, ori, beq
  - **J-Types**: j, jal, jr
